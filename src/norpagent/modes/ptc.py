"""PTC mode (Programmatic Tool Composition):
the model composes multi-step tool calls by generating Python code.

Difference from standard mode: instead of issuing tool calls one by one, the model
writes "which tools to call and how to combine results" as a code snippet, executed
by the run_python tool. Suitable for multi-step orchestration tasks needing
conditions, loops and batched aggregation.
