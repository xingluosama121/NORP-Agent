"""Standard mode: a fully featured general coding assistant (full P3 capability set).

Component composition (all replaceable):
- model openai_compat (--model mock verifies the flow; norpagent[openai] provides the SDK)
- session sqlite: persistent task history, resume chat after restart
- scheduler persistent: long-run tasks persisted to disk, resume after crash
- sandbox pooled: reuse + concurrency cap + timeout force-kill of process trees
- components: context_store=fts5 (cross-session searchable knowledge base), project_manager=basic

Full tool set: files / commands / web / context management / project management / long-run task cooperation.
