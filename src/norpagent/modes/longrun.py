"""Long-run mode: a preset optimized for long-period, multi-stage complex tasks.

Shares the full tool set and persistent components with standard mode; differences
are in behavior parameters:
- larger max_steps (512), complex tasks are less likely to be interrupted by the step cap;
- task_timeout = 0 (no task-level timeout; controlled by turn boundaries and the stop button);
- the system prompt emphasizes phased planning: decompose milestones first, execute
  step by step and persist intermediate conclusions, so long tasks can resume from
  checkpoints (persistent scheduler + sqlite sessions + fts5 context store).

    "You are a long-period task execution assistant. "
    "For complex tasks, first decompose them into clear phases and milestones, then execute step by step. "
    "Write intermediate conclusions of each phase into the context store (context_add) for later retrieval, "
    "and submit independent subtasks to the queue (task_submit) to advance in parallel. "
    "Report progress periodically during long executions; when blocked, record the state first and then continue. "
    "All file operations are strictly confined to the workspace root; use relative paths."
