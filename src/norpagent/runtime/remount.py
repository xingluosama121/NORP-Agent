"""Runtime hot remount: any slot can be replaced at runtime.

After np() starts, while the engine is still RUNNING, replace any slot
implementation at any time:

    import norpagent as np
    np()                                   # start (default web frontend)
    ...
    np.remount(model="openai_compat")      # swap the model: takes effect on the next run()
    np.remount(tools=["echo", "get_time"]) # swap the tool set: takes effect on the next run()
    np.remount(session="sqlite")           # swap session storage: AgentRuntime hot-rebuilds
    np.remount(security="high")            # swap the security level: old protection hooks unsubscribe first
    np.remount(frontend="norpagent.frontends.console:ConsoleFrontend")
    np.remount(async_loop="myapp.loop:create")
    np.remount(model="myapp.model:create") # replace a module file at runtime (module cache invalidated)

Replacement semantics grouped by slot:

1. **component slots** (model / tools / hooks / security / plugins):
   reapplied to the same registry and rewrite the final preset. model / tools
   take effect on the next run() — the agent loop re-resolves models and tool
   schemas on every run. Architecture-level subscriptions (hook extensions /
   security kit / plugins) unsubscribe the old ones before remounting; duplicate
   firing never stacks.

2. **assembly slots** (session / sandbox / scheduler / ui / agent_runtime /
   preset / context_store / project_manager): these components are resolved at
   AgentRuntime construction time; after replacement the runtime is **hot-rebuilt**
   — the old runtime closes (releasing sandboxes / components / unsubscribing the
   renderer), the new runtime assembles per the current architecture layer, and
   the frontend renderer rebinds (the HTTP port stays the same).

3. **infrastructure slots** (frontend / async_loop): stop the old implementation,
   start the new one. When async_loop is replaced, in-flight tasks on the old
   loop are abandoned (see _swap_loop); a frontend replacement failure
   auto-rolls-back to the old frontend.

4. **base-service slots** (logger / storage / error_handler): directly update
   engine references; no structure rebuild needed.

5. **custom slots** (v0.9 hot-pluggable slot table): slots registered via
   register_slot() can also be np.remount-ed — reapplied per the spec's applier
   (must be reentrant-safe); custom assembly slots with
   remount_rebuild_agent=True hot-rebuild the AgentRuntime after replacement,
   consistent with built-in assembly slots.

6. **page hot-replace keys** (html / flow_html, v0.9): they are mount parameters
   of the frontend slot rather than the slot itself — remounting a page does not
   restart the HTTP service and keeps the port unchanged; a browser refresh shows
   the new page; falsy values (None / "") unmount and fall back to the library's
   built-in assets. They are also written into engine.params so later frontend
   hot mounts / attach reuse the new values (the same data path as the np(html=...)
   startup passthrough). When the user registers a same-named custom slot via
   register_slot, the slot table takes priority (handled per slot semantics).

Any slot can be remounted — this is the runtime embodiment of "everything except
the minimal bottom kernel is a slot": assemblies can swap parts while running;
the slot table itself can also plug in new slots while running (register_slot).
