"""LoopRuntime protocol: the unified contract of the event loop system.

Implementations of the ``async_loop`` slot (i.e. the architecture function
norpagent.nasyncio()) must satisfy this protocol. The default implementation is
the library's built-in **self-developed nasyncio adapter**
(norpagent.loops.nasyncio.NasyncioLoopRuntime; scheduling core is
norpagent.nasyncio, no dependency on the standard asyncio); filling in an address
replaces it with any event loop system, swapping out the whole scheduling core.

The loop system is fully decoupled from agent logic: the engine (runtime.engine)
interacts with the loop only through this protocol and never imports any concrete
loop implementation.
