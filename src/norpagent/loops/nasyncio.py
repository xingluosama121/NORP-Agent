"""Self-developed nasyncio loop adapter: the default implementation of the async_loop slot.

A dedicated thread runs a self-developed nasyncio event loop
(norpagent.nasyncio.EventLoop, fully self-developed, zero asyncio dependencies);
submit() hands synchronous functions to the **own daemon worker pool** and blocks
waiting for the result. Fully transparent to the upper layer — to replace it with
any event loop system, just implement the LoopRuntime protocol and fill in the
async_loop slot address.

This module does not import the standard asyncio. The scheduling core (event loop /
Future / Task / coroutine trampoline / self-pipe wakeup) all come from the
library's built-in self-developed ``norpagent.nasyncio`` core (originally
nasync_io, now packaged into the library).

Why the default core replaced the standard asyncio (embracing the self-developed nasyncio):

- **control**: cancellation / stop / cross-thread wakeup semantics are all defined
  by in-library code. The standard asyncio's Task.cancel() is not thread-safe; its
  cross-thread add_done_callback goes through call_soon without writing the
  self-pipe (a loop blocked on the selector never gets the wakeup); the
  self-developed core fixes all of these pitfalls (Task.cancel thread-safe,
  cross-thread Future completion notifications automatically go through the
  self-pipe, abort_main() stops immediately);
- **dependency surface**: the self-developed core only depends on non-asyncio
  standard modules such as threading / selectors / socket / heapq — the full
  audit surface is the library's own code;
- **exit semantics**: does not use asyncio's default ThreadPoolExecutor (its
  worker threads are registered in CPython's threading._threads_queues and force-joined
  at interpreter exit — a stuck task would freeze the process).

Cancellation semantics (the key design for Ctrl+C usability):

- submit() waits by polling a threading.Event (every ≤poll_interval seconds,
  default 0.05s, tunable via config / NORPAGENT_SUBMIT_POLL) to return to a
  bytecode boundary: on Windows the main thread's pending interrupt is only
  checked at bytecode boundaries once WaitForSingleObject swallows it, and a
  single blocking Event.wait() would make Ctrl+C dead — polling wait solves this
  completely; the main thread's Ctrl+C **immediately** surfaces as
  KeyboardInterrupt;
- every task is wrapped in a contextvars context carrying a cancel event
  (norpagent.loops.cancel). On KeyboardInterrupt that cancel event is set:
  sandboxes force-kill child processes immediately, model streaming loops
  interrupt, tools exit early — worker threads no longer wait stupidly for timeouts;
- interrupt() cancels all in-flight tasks (called by engine request_stop);
- worker threads are bare daemon threads + queue (reason in "exit semantics" above).
